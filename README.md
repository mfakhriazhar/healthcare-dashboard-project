# Healthcare Dataset Analysis and Dashboard Reporting Project
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of healthcare data using Power BI. It focuses on understanding patient distribution, billing trends, and hospital performance through a clean and interactive dashboard.

## Project Overview

The Healthcare Data Dashboard project is a personal data visualization initiative aimed at exploring key insights from a large-scale healthcare dataset containing over 55,000 patient records. The dataset includes demographic details, admission types, billing amounts, medical conditions, and hospital metadata. The primary focus of this project is to apply data cleaning, perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and design an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to reveal trends and patterns that are critical in healthcare operations. With tools like **Excel** for preprocessing and **Power BI** for reporting, this project showcases how raw data can be transformed into meaningful visual insights that support better decision-making in the healthcare sector.

## Project Goals
- Perform data cleaning and preparation of raw healthcare data
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and distributions
- Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI to display key insights
- Present insights to support decision-making in healthcare management

## Dataset

- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset
- Size: ~55,000 rows
- Fields include:
  - Patient demographics (Age, Gender)
  - Admission and discharge details
  - Medical condition & billing information
  - Hospital and doctor metadata

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Power BI: Dashboard building & data visualization

Note :  
At the beginning of this project, I planned to perform data cleaning and preprocessing using MySQL. However, due to my device's limitations in handling large data imports, I ultimately opted for a more user-friendly alternative: Microsoft Excel.

## Dashboard Highlights

| Insight | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total Patients | 55.5K patients across various hospitals |
| Medical Conditions | Arthritis, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, etc. |
| Avg. Billing by Age Group | Age group 36â€“50 has the highest avg. billing |
| Hospital Overview | Patient count per hospital & length of stay |
| Admission Types | Elective, Emergency, and Urgent distribution |
| Interactivity | Filter by year, age group, gender, and admission type |
| Reset Button | Single-click slicer reset feature included |

## Key Insights

- Majority of admissions are Elective (33.61%) and Emergency (33.47%)
- Highest average billing occurs in patients aged 36â€“50
- Length of stay averages at 15.51 days
- Billing and patient volume vary significantly across hospitals

---

## Conclusion

This dashboard provides a high-level overview of healthcare metrics, supporting strategic analysis for improving hospital resource planning, patient management, and billing efficiency. It can serve as a foundational tool for healthcare analysts or managers.

## Notes

- Data has been cleaned in Excel prior to dashboarding
- MySQL integration is planned in future iterations
- Dashboard screenshots and `.pbix` file can be found in the `assets` folder
